# Twitter Data Analysis and User Relationship Mapping

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter user data using the **Twitter API**, extract meaningful insights, and establish user connections based on common interests. The project employs **hash tables** for efficient data organization and **graph algorithms** to map user relationships dynamically.

## Objectives
- Retrieve and process Twitter user data.
- Organize and structure user information using hash tables.
- Model user relationships as a **graph**.
- Identify and match users with similar interests based on tweets, followers, and followings.
- Implement **graph algorithms** (DFS, BFS, Minimum Spanning Tree) to analyze user interactions.
- Generate analytical reports and trend lists.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Data Handling:** JSON file storage (No database usage)
- **Data Structures:** Hash tables, graphs, linked lists
- **Graph Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, Minimum Spanning Tree
- **API Integration:** Twitter API for user data collection
- **Analysis & Reporting:** Text file-based report generation

## User Data Structure
Each user is represented as an object with the following attributes:
- **Username**
- **Full Name**
- **Follower Count**
- **Following Count**
- **Language and Region**
- **Tweet Content**
- **Followings and Followers**

## Data Retrieval and Hash Table Implementation
- Twitter user data is retrieved using the **Twitter API**.
- Each user's information is stored in **hash tables** for efficient access.
- Hash tables store users' interests as keys and associated users as values.
- The **LinkedListHashMap** structure is used to efficiently manage user data.
- All operations are performed on objects, ensuring a structured approach.
- The entire hashing algorithm is implemented from scratch (without built-in hash functions).

## Graph-Based User Relationship Modeling
- Users are represented as **nodes** in a graph.
- **Edges** represent the following-followers relationships.
- The graph dynamically updates based on real-time data.

## Interest-Based User Matching
- Usersâ€™ interests are stored in **hash tables**.
- A **search algorithm** is implemented to find users sharing similar interests.
- The system establishes connections between users based on:
  - **Followings and followers**
  - **Tweet content similarity**
  - **Hashtags used in tweets**
- Common interests between users are identified using **comparison algorithms**.
- Matched users are displayed in a structured output.

## Graph Analysis
- **BFS Algorithm:** Used to explore users within a defined level of connectivity.
- **DFS Algorithm:** Extracts tweets containing specific keywords and hashtags.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):**
  - Establishes the most efficient network between users with shared interests.
  - Reduces unnecessary connections while retaining a structured network.

## Search and Trend Analysis
- Search for users sharing specific interests using **hashing and search algorithms**.
- Extract **trending hashtags** and topics by language and region.
- Identify users discussing common themes.
- Generate detailed reports containing:
  - **Most popular topics per region.**
  - **Trending hashtags per language.**
  - **User interactions based on common interests.**

## Results and Reports
- Generate **text-based reports** documenting the analysis.
- Present user **interest-based communities** and their interactions.
- Display **structured relationship data** extracted from the user graph.
- Summarize findings on common trends, user similarities, and engagement patterns.
